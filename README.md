## My inspiration comes from an exhibition called Existence in the Flow Creates Vortices by TeamLab. In this artwork, particles on the ground move and connect with each other as people walk by, eventually forming whirlpools. This kind of transformation and interactive effect is what I want to incorporate into my project. This technique is beneficial because it transforms static images into interactive particle effects, allowing the audience to have a more immersive experience.It combines traditional art with digital technology, which fits the assignment requirements.


# Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration

## The coding technique comes from the Connected Particles project in p5.js. In this code, many small particles move randomly and form lines when they get close to each other. By using similar logic, an image can be turned into particles that react to the mouse, connecting or repelling as it moves. By adding noise-based movement, rotation, and other effects, the particles can create dynamic and interactive behaviors similar to the interactive effect described in Part 1.
