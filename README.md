## My inspiration comes from an exhibition called Existence in the Flow Creates Vortices by TeamLab. The artwork uses flowing particles, and when people walk through them, whirlpools appear. This kind of transformation and interactive effect is what I want to incorporate into my project. This technique is beneficial because it transforms static images into interactive particle effects, allowing the audience to have a more immersive experience.It combines traditional art with digital technology, which fits the assignment requirements.
