## My inspiration comes from an exhibition called Existence in the Flow Creates Vortices by TeamLab. The artwork uses flowing particles, and when people walk through them, whirlpools appear. This kind of transformation and interactive effect is what I want to incorporate into my project. This technique is beneficial because it transforms static images into interactive particle effects, allowing the audience to have a more immersive experience.It combines traditional art with digital technology, which fits the assignment requirements.

# Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration
## A coding technique that can help is particle mapping with interaction logic. The image is changed into many small particles, and then these particles react when the mouse moves, creating a repelling effect. On this basis, more interactions can be added, like clicking or touching, so the particles can attract, spread, rotate, or change color. This method turns a static image into a dynamic and interactive artwork, making it more interesting and engaging for the audience.
